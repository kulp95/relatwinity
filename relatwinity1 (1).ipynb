    "\n",

    "Without considering special relativity, one might say they are still the same age, of course! Although one has taken a trip to space, the same amount of time has passed for each twin and thus they are still the same age, because that's how time works, right? \n",
    "\n",
    "As we learn about special relativity, we will come to realize that this is not quite true. When we take the relativistic speed of Twin B into consideration, we will see that one twin does end up younger than the other. \n",

    "### What is Special Relativity?\n",
    "\n",
    "In introductory physics courses, we learn about things like gravity, acceleration, projectile motion, and friction. This is called Newtonian physics, and while it is generally an accurate way to describe the motion in our every day lives, it does not take *all* the laws of physics into consideration. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of these neglected effects is called special relativity. Relativity applies to all motion to a small extent, though it is only really relevant to objects moving at extremely high speeds (close to the speed of light, 3·10<sup>8</sup> meters per second). \n",
    "\n",
    "In special relativity, we examine the following questions: What if time was not definite, but relative? What if objects seemed to be different sizes at different speeds? What happens when we consider motion from the reference frame of the moving object, instead of the reference frame of the stationary observer?\n",
    "\n",
    "One basic yet vital concept that must be learned to understand relativity is that of a reference frame. A reference frame (more accurately, an inertial frame) essentially refers to the perspective of a certain observer or object. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you are standing on a sidewalk and you see a car passing by, you claim that you are stationary (relative to the ground) and that the person driving the car is moving with some velocity, v. However, the driver claims that she is stationary (relative to the car) and that you are moving with the velocity, v, in the opposite direction.*\n",
    "\n",
    "These are different frames of reference, defined by a set coordinate system (like the ground or the car in this case). Both observers are \"correct\" - They just have different perspectives *due to their motion*. Essentially, an inertial frame is defined by an observer or object's specific surrounding coordinate system which is reliant on its motion. Thus, this coordinate system is only upheld when the motion of the observer or object is unchanging. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\* *This is an example of Galilean relativity. If you are struggling with the concept of reference frames or special relativity in general, Galilean relativity problems may be helpful as they are more familiar.\n",

    "### Basic Rules of Special Relativity \n",
    "\n",
    "Although relativity is a very complex concept, it can be boiled down to a few key points for the purposes of this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some fundamental assumptions that we must keep in mind are: \n",
    "1. Nothing can travel faster than light. ($c=3\\cdot10^{8} m/s$)\n",
    "2. The same laws of physics apply to all reference frames.\n",
    "3. Every reference frame observes the same speed of light. \n",
    "4. There is no prefered reference frame - Any observer can accurately claim to be at rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the conclusions that result from these assumptions are: \n",
    "1. Time dilation - Observers in different reference frames experience differences in time elapsed.\n",
    "2. Length contraction - Observers in different reference frames experience differences in lengths of objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also several important formulas in special relativity. These are the few that are commonly taught in introductory physics: <br>\n",
    "* $t=t_{0}\\gamma$ *(time dilation)*\n",
    "* $L=\\frac{L_{0}}{\\gamma}$ *(length contraction)*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also more detailed (and more reliable) special relativity formulas, which are called Lorentz Transforms:\n",
    "* $x = \\gamma(x_{0} + vt_{0})$ *(space transform)*\n",
    "* $t = \\gamma(t_{0} + \\frac{v}{c^{2}}x_{0})$ *(time transform)*\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these formulas, gamma ($\\gamma$) is a factor which allows for conversion from one frame to another. This is also called the Lorentz factor. Gamma is always a quantity greater than 1 for any object in motion relative to another object. \n",
    "* $\\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*More in-depth explanations, proofs, and derivations of these phenomena and formulas can be found in the references at the end of this notebook, but for now, let's take these to be true so we can apply them to the Twin Paradox.*"

    "### The Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's attempt to solve the Twin Paradox problem and find out which twin is younger after the trip to the star. Recall that in the *Basic Rules of Special Relativity* section of this notebook, we learned about time dilation and length contraction. While both of these concepts can be examined in the context of this problem, let's focus on time dilation, as the ultimate question we seek to answer is to do with changes in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that time dilation is the difference in time experienced by observers in different reference frames. The associated formulas for time dilation are:\n",
    "* $t = t_{0}\\gamma$ *(basic formula)*\n",
    "* $t = \\gamma(t_{0} + \\frac{v}{c^{2}}x_{0})$ *(detailed formula; Lorentz transform)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Also recall that in these formulas, the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) is a factor which allows for conversion from one frame to another. This factor is always a quantity greater than 1 for any object in motion relative to another object. \n",
    "* $\\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about what the basic formula tells us in the context of the Twin Paradox without plugging in specific values. Here, we are converting the time experienced by the traveling twin (B) to the time experienced by the twin on Earth (A). So in the above formulas, $t$ represents the time experienced by the stationary twin (A), and $t_{0}$ represents the time experienced by the moving twin (B). \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be rewritten as $t_{stationary} = t_{moving}\\gamma$.<br>\n",
    "If the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) is always a quantity greater than 1, then we know based on this formula that **the moving twin will experience less time passing than the stationary twin**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when the twins meet up again on Earth, the twin who traveled to a distant star (B) is **younger** than the twin who remained on Earth (A)! This is the correct solution, and can also be found using the detailed formula as shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's similarly rewrite the Lorentz Transform as $t_{stationary} = \\gamma(t_{moving} + \\frac{v}{c^{2}}x_{moving})$. <br> \n",
    "Here, $x_{moving}$ represents the position of Event III from the reference frame of the moving twin (B). Because both twins started in the same position (on Earth, both claiming that both of them are at $x = 0$), they would also both define their ending positions as $x = 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the entire $x_{moving}$ term goes to zero, and the Lorentz Transform now becomes $t_{stationary} = \\gamma(t_{moving})$. This turned out to be the same result as the basic formula, so we find yet again that the traveling twin (B) is younger. \n",
    "\n",
    "*________*\n",
    "\n",
    "But, **something is off here.** Recall the *Basic Rules of Special Relativity* section of this notebook and see if you spot any inconsistencies with this solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Aha, there appears to be a paradox here (who would've thought)! \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's remember that *any observer can accurately claim that they are stationary*; There is no preferred reference frame. Just like in the Galilean relativity example, the traveling twin can claim that he is not moving with some velocity, v, but instead it is the twin on Earth who is moving with some velocity, v, in the opposite direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, when we apply the same logic as before using $t_{stationary} = t_{moving}\\gamma$ or the Lorentz Transform, we find that the twin on Earth experienced less time than the traveling twin, and thus **the twin on Earth (A) is actually the younger one.** Of course, it is impossible for both twins to be simulataneously younger than each other! This clearly seems like a paradox. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, after coming to this conclusion, what are our options? \n",
    "1. The Twin Paradox logically disproves special relativity (Einstein is wrong!)\n",
    "2. Something is off or missing in the above solution (We are wrong!)\n",
    "\n",

    "This acceleration is not in itself the direct cause of the apparent paradox we found above, but in this specific example, it does lead us to the key problem. When Twin B accelerates by turning around, *he is exceeding the limits of his initial inertial frame*. That is, **the frame in which he existed during his outgoing trip to the distant star is *not* the same as the frame in which he existed during his return trip.** While the acceleration does cause Twin B's inertial frame to change, it is important to discern that it is not the acceleration that causes the issue, but the changing of the inertial frame itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look closely at a more technical definition of an inertial frame, we see that the crucial requirement is unchanging motion, either remaining at rest or remaining in motion at some velocity, v.* Remember that velocity is not only a speed, but a direction; Thus, if an object *accelerates* either by changing speed or changing direction, the inertial frame no longer applies to the object.\n",

    "\n",
    "While Twin A remains in an inertial frame on Earth for the entirety of the problem, Twin B experiences two different inertial frames (one on the outgoing trip, moving at velocity $+v$, and a separate one on the return trip, moving at velocity $-v$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that there are two moving inertial frames and only one stationary inertial frame allows us to distinguish between the two types of motion (whereas previously we believed there were only two reference frames, both of which could correctly claim to be stationary while having two obviously different types of motion). Now we know that the third reference frame provides clarity by offering an outside perspective about the other two reference frames' motions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***When we apply this new insight to the Twin Paradox and solve it as three separate reference frames, it does agree with our initial conclusion that Twin B (the traveling twin) is younger when they meet back up on Earth. However, this should not cloud the importance of the clarifications made above; Without it, the solution would be impossible and paradoxical!***\n",
